# TypeScript Support

The Inferno project and all its modules are written in TypeScript. The typings are included in the distribution. The main Inferno project source can be checked out and imported directly into your TS application.

## Example Repository

Don't forget to have a look at the [`inferno-typescript-example` repository](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno-typescript-example) which lays out the structure of a sample component. The example uses Webpack for compiling your distribution files and a sample `tsconfig` file.

## Example with custom Typescript transformer

Both Webpack and FuseBox examples exist for the custom Typescript transformer (ts-transform-inferno). You can checkout the [repository](https://github.com/deamme/ts-transform-inferno) and then the examples folder.

## Why Typescript?

Typescript has been a pleasure to use on the Inferno project. During development we found that it provided many benefits. According to core team developers, TypeScript saved the project from a lot of potentially difficult bugs. Its type safety, fast compiler and language features worked wonderfully for the Inferno team.
